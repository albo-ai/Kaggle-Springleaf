Kaggle competition: Springleaf Marketing Response

## Introduction
This repo contains ipython notebooks prepared for the Kaggle competition: Springleaf Marketing Response.Springleaf offers their customers personal and auto loans that help them take control of their lives and their finances. Direct mail is one important way Springleaf's team can connect with customers whom may be in need of a loan. In order to improve their targeted effort, Springleaf would like to focus on the customers who are likely to respond and be good candidates for their services.

Using a large set of <em>anonymized</em> features, Springleaf is asking us to predict which customers will respond to a direct mail offer. 

## Data
A high-dimensional dataset of <em>anonymized</em> customer information is provided. Each entry (row) corresponds to one customer. the response variable is binary. There are over 140,000 entries in both the test and training set.
